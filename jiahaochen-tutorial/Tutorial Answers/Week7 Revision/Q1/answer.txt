 + What does the #include directive do?
    the C preprocessor to include the contents of the file specified in 
    the input stream to the compiler and then continue with the rest of 
    the original file.

 + What are include guards and when should they be used?
    Avoid some duplicated definitions
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard

 + Why are the extra brackets around a, b and a < b necessary in the macro
definition for MIN? For example what happens with MIN(a++, 1)

    a is incremented twice

    with brackets: 
        #define MIN(a, b) ((a < b) ? (a) : (b))
    without:
        #define MIN(a, b) (a < b ? a : b)
